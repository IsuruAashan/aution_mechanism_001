# Running Auction Simulations - Readme
Game theroy approach for simulate auction mechanism.

This Python script allows to simulate auctions using different auction mechanisms. The script includes two classes: Bidder and Auction. Here's how to run the simulations:

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
1. Download the Script:
Download the Python script that includes the Bidder and Auction classes.

2. Customize the Auction:
Open the script in a text editor/Python IDE. The following parameters can be customized  before running the simulations:

num_bidders: The number of bidders in the auction.
auction_type: Set it to 'first_price' for a first-price auction or 'second_price' for a second-price auction.
num_rounds: The number of auction rounds to simulate.
You can modify these parameters to suit your auction simulation requirements.

3. Run the Script:

Save the script with modified custom parameters and execute it using Python.
